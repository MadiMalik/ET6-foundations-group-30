# Git it Done  

## Overview  
Welcome to the **Git it Done** repository!  

This is a collaborative learning project where our team works together to solve problems and learn new skills. Each teammate will:  
- Solve 2 problems.  
- Help resolve 2 problems contributed by others.  

Our team is made up of people with different levels of experience—some of us are complete beginners, while others have a little experience. But one thing we all share is a strong eagerness to learn. By the end of this project, we will no longer be complete beginners.  

We are learning collaboratively, growing through our mistakes, and working as a team to improve.  .
